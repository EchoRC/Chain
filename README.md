# Chain

This project is based on blockchain information simulation landing. Currently it is java language. Follow-up will be implemented in python language. According to the principle of blockchain, distributed data storage is realized, and data encryption and data transmission are realized through blockchain coding technology, and multiple scenarios are pre-constructed. Storage module: Stored within the Block is a Sql statement. Set the database table structure that meets the needs of the business scenario in advance, and then set the operation permission (ADD, UPDATE, DELETE) of each node to the table. In the future, each node can perform the Sql statement preparation according to its permission. And packaged into the Block, and then broadcast the entire network, waiting for the entire network to verify the validity of the signature, permissions and other information. If the Block is valid, it is allowed to generate, and then the network-wide broadcast is generated and each node pulls a new block. After the new block is generated, each node analyzes the content of the block and performs the operation of loading and unloading the block. Webcast: At the network layer, each node is connected to each other and disconnected, and then the heartbeat packet is maintained. The network framework uses t-io and is also a well-known open source project of oschina. T-io adopts the AIO method and has excellent performance in a large number of long-term connections, and it also consumes very little resources. It also includes excellent features such as heartbeat packets, disconnected reconnection, and retry. In the project, each node is a server and a client. As a server, it is connected to other N-1 nodes, and as a client, it is connected to the servers of other N-1 nodes. Consensus algorithm: Modify the pbft algorithm, set each node to be equal, and the performance is higher. You don't need to select the leader. Any node can build Block, and then broadcast on the entire network. When other nodes receive the Block request, they enter the Pre-Prepare state, check the format, hash, signature, and table permissions. After the check passes, they enter the Prepare state and broadcast to the entire network. When the number of Prepare nodes to be accumulated by itself is greater than 2f+1, the commit state is entered, and the entire network broadcasts this state. When the number of Commit nodes to be accumulated by itself is greater than 2f+1, it is considered that a consensus has been reached that the block is added to the block chain, and then the sql statement in the block is executed to store the data. For querying block information, you only need to query the database, which improves efficiency.
